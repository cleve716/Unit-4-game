Crystal Collector

Added more random crystal values by expanding to a 7 number array. The array is randomly re-sorted after a win or loss. Index values 0-3  of the reshuffled array are assigned to the four crystals. This increases the variety of potential crystal values. It also assures that each crystal value will be unique... no duplicate crystal numbers.
